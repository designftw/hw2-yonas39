          The MIT Management Sloan School Office of Diversity,Equity and
          Inclusion webpage did well in organization of the website. In its home
          page the name of the office was clearly written in a white color
          aligned to the center of the page with a beautiful colorfull
          background image. Right under the page title there is a small box that
          contain 4 directory elements that also is aligned to the center.
          Following the directory elements box there are texts, images and list
          of people. All texts are aligned to the center except the one's that
          needs some emphasis. As of Feb 20, 2023, the website given an emphais
          to a box of text by breaking the alignment the webpage follows.
          Similarly, they used the same technique when they introduce team
          member or a certain important info i.e, image.

          The other aspect that worth discussing about the web page is its
          consistency and repetition. I manage to go through the website and and
          tried to obserb their design concept. It was impresive how they are
          consistent and repetitive through out the website. if you click on
          each of the selection directory from homepage you will see all of them
          followed the center alignment and the intensional misaligned pieces.
          In adition, they used all the same method when they introduce an image
          to the website. either they put the image on the left and write
          discription to the right of an image or they put the image and
          description followed under the image. it make it easy to follow along
          for the users and give a good structure for the website. <br />
          I noticed one thing that was was very consistent and repetitive
          throughout the webpages was in our team section. In this section they
          chose to put the headshot images of the staff members and put it in a
          circle and then a small Discription about the person to the right.
          Name set to be Bold and larger font size. If you become curious and
          want to learn more about the person and click on learn more option
          that is found under the discription then you will be redirected to a
          new page that has the MIT dom as a background image and the circle
          head shot image of the person you want to learn more. this page also
          followed the center alignment and display the name of the person bold
          and larger font, contact info and their title, and about (simple bio).
          This is consistent for all the individuals I looked up.
