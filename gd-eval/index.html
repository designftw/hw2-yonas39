          This section will evaluate and discuss the strength and weaknesses of
          the Graphic Design of MIT Sloan School Management Office of Diversity,

          As per The Principle of Design there are multiple ways of analyzing a
          graphics design, i.e,.

          <li>Alignment</li>
          <li>Repetition</li>

          <li>Contrast</li>
          <li>Simplicity</li>

          For the sake of this assignment, I will discuss about the alignment
          and repetition aspects of the MIT Management Sloan School Office of
          Diversity,Equity and Inclusion webpage.

          The MIT Sloan School Management Office of Diversity,Equity and
          Inclusion webpage did well in organization of the website. In its home
          page the name of the office was clearly written in a white color
          aligned to the center of the page with a beautiful colorfull
          background image. Right under the page title there is a small box that
          contain 4 directory elements that also is aligned to the center.
          Following the directory elements box there are texts, images and list
          of people. All texts are aligned to the center except the one's that
          needs some emphasis. As of Feb 20, 2023, the website gives an emphasis
          to a certain texts breaking the center alignment. Although this breaks
          the alignment rule it is a great way to catch users attendtion.
          Similarly, they used the same technique when they introduce team
          member or a certain important info i.e, image.

            <div>
              The texts are center aligned, at times they break the alignement
              rule to add emphasis on some texts

                width="350px"
                height="350px"
              />
            </div>
            <hr />
          </div>

          <div class="grid_small">
            Images also break alignment to catch users attention look the image below:
            <div class="grid_images">
              <img
                src="image/Alignment_1.png"
                alt="screen copy of the website"
                width="350px"
                height="350px"
              />
            
            </div>
            <hr />

      <div>
        <p class="group_head">Repetition</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph_inline">
        <p>
          The other aspect that worth discussing about the web page is its
          consistency and repetition. I manage to go through the website and and
          tried to observe their design concept. It was impresive how they are
          consistent and repetitive through out the website. if you click on
          each of the selection directory from homepage you will see all of them
          followed the center alignment and the intensional misaligned pieces.
          In adition, they used all the same method when they introduce an image
          to the website. either they put the image on the left and write
          discription to the right of an image or they put the image and
          description followed under the image. it make it easy to follow along
          for the users and give a good structure for the website. <br />
          I also noticed a good thing that was was very consistent and
          repetitive throughout in the webpages found in our team section. In
          this section they chose to put the headshot images of the staff
          members and put it in a circle and then a small Discription about the
          person to the right. Name set to be Bold and larger font size. If you
          become curious and want to learn more about the person and click on
          learn more option that is found under the discription then you will be
          redirected to a new page that has the MIT dom as a background image
          and the circle head shot image of the person you want to learn more
          about. this page also followed the center alignment and display the
          name of the person bold and larger font, contact info and their title,
          and about (simple bio). This is consistent for all the individuals I
          looked up. I would recommend if they keep the proximity for the learn
          text a bit closer so users can find it easily.
