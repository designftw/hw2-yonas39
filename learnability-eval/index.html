      <p>
        For the Given assignment I chose to use figma since I never interacted
        with it before. Before I jump right in, I tried to learn what it does.
        Soon after a short research and I went to the www.figma.com website and
        created a user account. Simlar to other accont creation methods it was
        also an easy and straight forward process. Soon after signing up, I went
        stragiht to new design file button to creat a business card for the
        ideal company employee JonDoe.
        <br />
        Based on my experience and observation, new users like me may face the
        following challengs while trying to learn/use figma
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Complexity: Sigma's interface may be overwhelming for a new user like
          my self. It was my first time interacting with vector graphic editor
          like figma and I find it complex and not intiutive as a new user. I
          was also having a hard time navigating to find the tools I needed to
          create a certain objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not enough materials:I was having a difficulty to create the hearth
          shape on the wifyme logo. I thought I was going to get support online
          and googled how I could do that but I didn't get the type of materials
          I was looking for so I extended my search to learn more about it. If
          figma provide oneline tutorials on yout tube or in thier own web page
          it might be very helpful for the new users like myself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rotation tools: I also strugled with the tools that I used to rotate
          the objects I created. the rotation works at times and disapear most
          times. I mentioned rotation because I strugled a lot with it, but
          other things that were very difficult to understand was removing
          unwanted sections of the object or shapes. I also googled to learn how
          to rotate objets but it should have been made easier for the users.
          especily in vector graphic design tools because users want to rotate
          objects frequently to look them from different angle and dimenstions.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In general if Figma simplifies its user interface and and more intiutive
        features like easy rotation, cut, past, and remove it will be easier for
        the new users to navigate through the app. In addition, if figma provide
        more guidance and training to the new users throught the app by video,
        documentation, chatbox etc it will facilitatet the learning process.
        Finally, with all the challenges I manage to create the first logo,
        business cara, envelop and letter papaer designs using figma and spent
        few hours to learn about it. Its a great tool that I will use in the
        feature. If figma provide more tutorials and certification options for
        interested design intusiasts like myself it can reduce the learnablity
        issue and drive more users to the platform.
